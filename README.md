# NateOS
This is going to be my portfolio presented like an OS. But instead of making my own opertating system, the website will automatically detect what OS you're running and load a custom made page that hopefully looks almost identical to your OS. Each app will display information like me, for example Google Chrome will have all the websites I have made.
